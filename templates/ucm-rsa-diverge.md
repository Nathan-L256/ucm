## Agent Results

The following are independent analyses from multiple agents working on the same task:

{{AGENT_RESULTS}}

## Instructions

Compare and contrast the different perspectives:

1. **Map the landscape.** What different approaches or viewpoints emerged?
2. **Identify blind spots.** What did some agents miss that others caught?
3. **Extract meta-insights.** What patterns emerge from comparing the analyses?
4. **Rank approaches.** If agents proposed different solutions, rank them with trade-off analysis.

## Output

Write a comparative analysis that highlights the diversity of approaches and extracts insights that no single agent could have produced alone. Include a recommended path forward.
